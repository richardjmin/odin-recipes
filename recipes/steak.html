        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe will teach you how to pan sear steaks. Whenever you cook anything,
            there is always a process. Everyone has an idea of how to cook the perfect steak, but it
            is a lot harder than people think. Temperature is a great clue of how you want the steak to 
            be cooked. For medium rare, it is 145 degrees F. Medium done is 165 degrees. Well done is 170 
            degrees.

            Steak. Final advice: always remember when cooking meat: <em>NEVER PLAY WITH YOUR MEAT!</em>
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs of New York Steak, Top Sirloin Steak, or Ribeye Steak</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp vegetable oil or olive oil</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp black pepper, freshly ground</li>
            <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled and quartered</li>
            <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pat dry - use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and
                and reduce oil splatter.
            </li>
            <li>Season generously - just before cooking the steaks, sprinkle both 
                sides liberally with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the pan on medium and brush with oil. Using 1/2 tbsp oil reduces splatter.</li>
            <li>Sear the steaks - add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust
                has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).
            </li>
            <li>Add butter and aromatics - melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary
                sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness.
            </li>
            <li>Remove steak and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.</li>
        </ol>
