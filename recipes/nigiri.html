        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Do you know what the difference is between maki and nigiri? Well, nigiri isn't rolled. 
            Instead, it is comprised of a thin slice of raw or cooked seafood atop a mound of 
            vinegary rice. Each piece of nigiri is eaten whole in one bite. The difference between sashimi
            and nigiri is that sashimi has no rice, but only the thin slice of raw or cooked fish. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Many people believe that the fish is the most important part of the dish. However, many famous
            Japanese sushi chefs say that the most important is the rice and not the fish. In Japan, many 
            trainees who aspire to become sushi chef often only learn how to prepare the rice first for
            up to 10 years! Whenever you eat sushi, it is imperative to use fresh fish unless you like having
            an upset stomach! <em>With greater risk, there is a bigger payout!</em>
